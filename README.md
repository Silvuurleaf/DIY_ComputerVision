# DIY_ComputerVision
This will be a collection of small and large projects I will be tackling in attempt to teach myself computer vision.

Right now I'm trying to follow the UW computer science HWs for computer vision: https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse455/18sp/.
Eventually I hope to implement from other projects, research papers, or things I think of.
